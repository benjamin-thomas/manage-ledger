## bin/ofx_to_ledger

It digests the ofx file, then halts on the first unsaved transaction, forcing
the user to either copy/paste the printed snippet, or update an existing
transaction with the given ofx_id.

This script does not write to the ledger file

## ./bin/sort_ledger

This script prints to STDOUT all the ledger file transactions, in ascending order.
